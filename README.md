# Crossy Road Clone

WIP Crossy Road clone written on top of pure WebGL for
my computer graphics final project. Svelte Kit used to manage
the front end UI components, like the menu, overlayed text,
and all input handling.

This demonstrates the rudimentary procedural generation
(as of Nov 30, 2023) and the memory management system.

# Try it for yourself

at https://crossy.simonwalker.tech  
or to run the development server locally, clone the repo and run
```bash
nom install
npm run dev
```
Note, the (vercel) site will reflect all the latest changes to this
repo automatically. The entire system should be almost completely
platform-agnostic by nature of WebGL.

# Next Steps

There's a lot left to do. The big stuff:
1. Shadow maps
2. Vehicles
3. Water/log "biome"
